# Philosophical Reasoning (IRF-Calc v0.0.2)

## Overview

Surface reasoning creates shallow insights. Ad-hoc thinking misses paradigm shifts.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS engage six philosophical dimensions before conclusion. Depth = IRF score.

## When to Use

- Strategic decision-making
- Research hypothesis formation
- Paradigm-shifting problems
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Root cause investigation

## The Iron Law

```
NO PHILOSOPHICAL CONCLUSION WITHOUT IRF SCORE ≥ 0.78
All six components (M,A,D,I,F,P) ≥ 0.70 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **E**: ≥ 0.78
- **M**: =0.75
- **A**: =0.78
- **D**: =0.03
- **I**: =0.77
- **F**: ≥ 0.78
- **P**: ≥ 0.70
- **IRF score**: < 0.78
- **Global score**: ≥ 0.78
