# Strategic Consulting & SaaS Strategy

## Overview

Generic advice without structure is noise. Strategy without governance creates execution drift.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS ground strategy in Constitutional Requirements and validate with BattleField diagnostics.

## When to Use

- SaaS product strategy
- Market positioning analysis
- Competitive landscape evaluation
- Growth strategy development
- Business model validation

## The Iron Law

```
NO STRATEGIC ADVICE WITHOUT CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDING
Strategy Drift D < 0.3 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **D**: < 0.3
