# Intent Classification & Semantic Routing

## Overview

Vague requests create execution chaos. Misclassified intent wastes resources.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS classify intent before execution. Route = correctness.

## When to Use

- Natural language commands
- API request routing
- Chatbot message handling
- Search query optimization
- Task delegation to sub-agents

## The Iron Law

```
NO EXECUTION WITHOUT INTENT CLASSIFICATION
Classification Confidence ≥ 0.85 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **Confidence score**: ≥ 0.85
