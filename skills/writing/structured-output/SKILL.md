# Structured Output Generation

## Overview

Unstructured output creates parsing errors. Schema violations break systems.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS generate output using validated templates. Structure = reliability.

## When to Use

- JSON/YAML/XML generation
- API responses
- Configuration files
- Structured documents (reports, forms)
- Data exports

## The Iron Law

```
NO STRUCTURED OUTPUT WITHOUT SCHEMA VALIDATION
Schema Compliance = 100% REQUIRED
```
