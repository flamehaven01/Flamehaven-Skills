# Drift-Free Writing

## Overview

Writing without validation creates semantic drift. Speed without structure loses intent.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS validate writing against original principles before delivery. Quality = intent preservation.

## When to Use

- Blog posts and articles
- Documentation and technical writing
- Marketing copy and landing pages
- Email communications
- Reports and proposals

## The Iron Law

```
NO CONTENT DELIVERY WITHOUT DRIFT VALIDATION
Drift Score D < 0.3 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **D**: < 0.3
- **LLM score**: ≥ 0.9
- **semantic score**: ≥ 0.9
