# Academic Writing with AI

## Overview

Manual academic writing is slow. AI without governance produces plagiarized or drifted content.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS use full Meta-Scholar pipeline for academic content. Quality gates prevent drift.

## The Iron Law

```
NO ACADEMIC PAPER WITHOUT AUTOMATED VALIDATION PIPELINE
```

## Thresholds

- **D**: < 0.3
- **Drift score**: < 0.3
