# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

- *Always:**
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Behavior changes

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```
