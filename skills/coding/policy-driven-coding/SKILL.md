# Policy-Driven Coding

## Overview

Code without policy creates security holes. Manual compliance is error-prone.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS enforce policy at generation time. Compliance = built-in.

## When to Use

- API endpoint development
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Data processing pipelines
- Configuration management
- Infrastructure as code

## The Iron Law

```
NO CODE DELIVERY WITHOUT POLICY GATE VALIDATION
Security Score ≥ 0.90 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **Security Score**: ≥ 0.90
- **Security score**: ≥ 0.90
- **compliance score**: ≥ 0.90
- **Compliance score**: ≥ 0.90
