**Core principle:** ALWAYS analyze multi-dimensional emotion flow with temporal tracking and influence network mapping.

## When to Use

- Social media monitoring
- Customer feedback analysis
- Political sentiment tracking
- Brand reputation management
- Market research and trend detection

## The Iron Law

```
NO SENTIMENT REPORT WITHOUT EMOTION FLOW VALIDATION
Confidence Score ≥ 0.75 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **Confidence Score**: ≥ 0.75
- **Confidence score**: ≥ 0.75
