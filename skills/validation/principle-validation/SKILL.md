# Principle Validation & Policy Enforcement

## Overview

Output without policy check is risk. Compliance without automation is slow.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS validate against Constitutional Requirements before delivery. Governance = mandatory.

## When to Use

- Code generation
- Content creation
- Strategic decisions
- Academic papers
- API responses

## The Iron Law

```
NO OUTPUT DELIVERY WITHOUT LAWBINDER VALIDATION
Compliance Score ≥ 0.80 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **Compliance Score**: ≥ 0.80
- **Compliance score**: ≥ 0.80
- **Ethics score**: ≥ 0.80
