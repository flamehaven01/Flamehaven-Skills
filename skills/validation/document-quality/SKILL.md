# Document Quality Validation (Scriptoria Ω)

## Overview

Documents without structure are noise. Quality without measurement is subjective.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS validate document quality with Ω scoring. Structure = trust.

## When to Use

- Academic papers
- Technical documentation
- API specifications
- Compliance documents
- Research reports

## The Iron Law

```
NO DOCUMENT CITATION WITHOUT Ω SCORE ≥ 0.90
Only validated documents are citable
```

## Thresholds

- **E**: ≥ 0.90
- **Structural score**: ≥ 0.85
- **Textual score**: ≥ 0.85
- **glossary score**: ≥ 0.70
- **Ω score**: < 0.90
