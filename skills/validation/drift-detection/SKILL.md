# Drift-Free Execution

## Overview

Random outputs violate principles. Quick execution masks semantic drift.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS validate semantic preservation before delivery. Drift = failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of execution.**

## When to Use

- Code generation
- Document writing
- Translation
- Refactoring
- API responses

## The Iron Law

```
NO OUTPUT DELIVERY WITHOUT DRIFT VALIDATION FIRST
Drift Score D < 0.3 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **D**: < 0.3
- **drift score**: < 0.3
