# AI Self-Validation & Identity Verification

## Overview

AI without self-validation is a black box. Drift goes undetected. Identity becomes unstable.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS validate AI's own consistency before claiming completion.

## The Iron Law

```
NO AI OUTPUT WITHOUT SELF-VALIDATION LOOP COMPLETION
Drift Score D < 0.3 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **D**: < 0.3
- **drift score**: < 0.3
- **Consistency score**: > 0.7
