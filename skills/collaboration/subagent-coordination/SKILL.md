# Subagent Coordination & Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Overview

Single-agent execution is slow. Uncoordinated agents create chaos.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS orchestrate with governance. Parallelism = controlled.

## When to Use

- Independent research tasks
- Multi-file code generation
- Parallel data processing
- Distributed testing
- Multi-perspective analysis

## The Iron Law

```
NO MULTI-AGENT EXECUTION WITHOUT COORDINATION PROTOCOL
Coordination Confidence ≥ 0.85 REQUIRED
```

## Thresholds

- **Drift score**: ≥ 0.3
